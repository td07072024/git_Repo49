Vrindavan (pronunciationⓘ; IAST: Vṛndāvana), also spelt Vrindaban and Brindaban,[3] is a historical city in the Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh, India. It is located in the Braj Bhoomi region and holds religious importance for Hindus who believe that Krishna, one of the main Gods in Hinduism, spent most of his childhood in this city.[4][5][6][7] Vrindavan has about 5,500 temples dedicated to the worship of Krishna and his chief consort, Radha.[8] It is one of the most sacred places for Vaishnava traditions.[4][8]

Vrindavan forms a part of the "Krishna pilgrimage circuit" under development by the Indian Ministry of Tourism. The circuit also includes Mathura, Barsana, Gokul, Govardhan, Kurukshetra, Dwarka and Puri.[9][10]
